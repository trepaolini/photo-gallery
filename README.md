## Description

This interactive photo gallery displays photos taken by Alejandro Escamilla that are available through the Lorem Picsum API.

The photo gallery allows you to enlarge photos and navigate between the gallery using arrow buttons.

The photo gallery also allow you to see all of the available photos as grayscale images, autoplay through all of the enlarged photos, and download your favorite photos.

## Technologies

I used HTML, CSS, and React to create this application. I also utilized the Reactstrap and FontAwesome libraries.
